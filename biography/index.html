            <p>
            Tradition says that the name Hepburn is derived from the names of two rivers—it
            is likely that the original Hepburn clan in Scotland lived near bodies of water
            (Document AR). The name had multiple variations before being finalized as
            Hepburn; these included Heborn, Hepbron, Hepborn, d’Hepburne, and even Esbron.
            The Hepburn Campbell family was of Scottish origin and had ties with the Earls
            of Bothwell in the Peerage of Scotland; Campbell's great-grandfather had direct
            ancestry to Rev. John Hepburn of Keith and remote ancestry to Patrick Hepburn,
            the third Lord Hailes and first Earl of Bothwell. It was in 1698 that Campbell's
            great-grandfather from his maternal side, Samuel Hepburn, was born in Glasgow,
            Scotland. In 1746 he married Janet Sinclair, a Scottish woman and soon to be
            great-grandmother of James. Campbell.
            </p>
            <p>
            Shortly after their marriage, they left Scotland due to religious persecution
            and settled in Donegal, Ireland (Document AR). They resided there for many
            years, in that time bearing four sons and one daughter: James, William, Samuel,
            John, and Janet Hepburn. At one point, Campbell's grandfather and
            great-grandfather received news of how America was the land of opportunity. This
            prompted Campbell's maternal grandfather, James Hepburn (age 26 at the time),
            and his brother, William Hepburn (age 18 at the time), to sail from Londonderry
            to Philadelphia in early 1773 to verify the promises of America for their
            father, Campbell's great grandfather. James Hepburn was satisfied with the
            advantages it would come to provide and settled in Philadelphia, making
            occasional trips back to the valley to assist with landwatching. With his wife
            and daughter, who unfortunately drowned during a storm, Samuel Hepburn sailed on
            the Faithful Steward from Londonderry to Philadelphia. His son James Hepburn and
            Mary Hopewell Hepburn would go on to get married on December 17, 1781, and have
            nine children: Samuel Hopewell Hepburn, Andrew Doz Hepburn, William Hepburn,
            James Hepburn, Jane Hepburn (Campbell's mother), Mary Hepburn, Hopewell Hepburn,
            William Hepburn and Sarah Hepburn.
            </p>
            <p>
            James H. Campbell’s father, Francis C. Campbell, was born in 1787 and grew up in
            York, Pennsylvania (Document AR). He went on to pursue his education at
            Dickinson College, where he, alongside his close friend David Watts, studied law
            and laid a path for his future son to soon follow (Document AX). After earning
            his law degree, Francis relocated to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where he met
            and married his future wife, Jane H. Campbell. While in Williamsport, he not
            only built a successful legal career spanning an impressive 50 years but also
            became a prominent and respected figure within the Lycoming County bar. He
            eventually died in 1867 shortly before the passing of his wife.<sup
            id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            James H. Campbell’s mother, Jane H. Campbell, was born on March 19, 1775 to
            James Hepburn and Mary Hopewell (Document AR). She was the sixth child of nine
            and the eldest daughter of her family. Her siblings were Samuel H. Hepburn,
            Andrew Doz Hepburn, William Hepburn, James Hepburn, John Hepburn, Mary Hepburn,
            Hopewell Hepburn, and Sarah Hepburn. Little is documented about her early life.
            However, it is known that she married Francis C. Campbell in May of 1816 and had
            nine children with him before passing at the age of 72 on May 17, 1867.<sup
            id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            Campbell had many siblings, including Catherine C. Campbell, Elizabeth Campbell,
            Francis C. Campbell, Frances H. Campbell, John R. Campbell, Alfred Campbell,
            Mary J. Campbell, and Sarah A. Campbell, born from 1818 to 1839 (Document
            AR).<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Although James
            had quite a number of siblings, many died within the first year of their lives.
            Besides James, Sarah Ann Campbell was the best documented of the children with
            the 1860 U.S. Census documenting her residence at her parent's house (Document
            K). Sarah resided at 2225 N 17th Street in Philadelphia for much of her life
            until her death in 1905 (Document AW). She was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery
            which indicates that while some of the Campbell family was buried in the
            Woodlands another portion is in the Laurel Hill Cemetery.<sup id="fnref4"><a
            href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            On February 8, 1820, James Hepburn Campbell himself was born in Williamsport,
            Pennsylvania to Francis C. Campbell and Jane H. Campbell (Document AR). Campbell
            grew up in a relatively affluent household, seeing as how his father Francis was
            a successful lawyer. Coincidentally, he grew up across the street from his
            future wife, Juliet Hamersley Lewis.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5"
            rel="footnote">5</a></sup> It was in Williamsport that Campbell “almost
            certainly” received his early education.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6"
            rel="footnote">6</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            On June 16, 1840, Campbell enrolled in Dickinson Law School which was headed by
            the local Judge John Reed in Carlisle, PA (Document A). According to the
            Department of Archives at Dickinson College, while Campbell did not live in
            Dickinson College housing, it is likely Campbell lived somewhere within the city
            based on the distance between Williamsport and Carlisle.<sup id="fnref7"><a
            href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> Campbell received his Bachelor of Laws
            diploma and graduated from the 16th Class in August of 1841.
            </p>
            <p>
            After he graduated from Dickinson Law College, Campbell moved to the South Ward
            of Pottsville and was admitted to the Bar on October 18, 1841 (Document B;
            Document D). In June of 1843, James Hepburn Campbell married Juliet Hamersley
            Campbell, formerly Juliet Hamersley Lewis. Juliet was born on August 5, 1823, to
            her parents, Ellis Lewis and Josephine Wallis Lewis.<sup id="fnref8"><a
            href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> Her father, Ellis, was appointed Attorney
            General for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1833, and it was then that he
            relocated their whole family to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where Juliet and
            James met. Her parents had sent her to the Moravian Seminary for Young Ladies in
            1835 and later to a French Boarding School in Philadelphia. The influences of
            her father and her education led her to begin writing at the age of 14; she
            eventually became an author, writing multiple full-length books and featuring
            her poetry in several national magazines.  Some of Juliet's most notable works
            included: her novel "The Old Love and the New" and poems in <em>Shell Music,
            </em>both published in The Potter journal on August 19, 1858; her poem
            <em>Hungary, </em>published in the Lewisburg Chronicle and the West Branch
            Farmer on December 12, 1849; and <em>A Story of Sunrise</em>, which was
            published in T.B. Read's <em>Female Poets of America </em>(Document C; Document
            I)<em>.</em><sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9"
            rel="footnote">9</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10"
            rel="footnote">10</a></sup><em> </em>Juliet balanced her successful career along
            with life as a mother to her four children, Julia Wharton Lewis Campbell, Ellis
            Lewis Campbell, James Jr. Campbell, and Francis Campbell, and as the wife to
            James H. Campbell.
            </p>
            <p>
            Juliet and James had their first son, Francis D. Campbell, in 1845; two years
            later, their son, James Jr. Campbell was born in 1847 (Document D). Francis was
            notably the Master’s Mate on the “Black Hawk” which was the flagship of the
            Mississippi Squadron; he resigned from his position on August 8, 1863 (Document
            AB). Unfortunately, both passed after fighting in the Civil War in 1864 and
            thus, little is documented about their lives.<sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11"
            rel="footnote">11</a></sup> In 1854, they welcomed another son named Ellis Lewis
            Campbell. Ellis became a lawyer in Philadelphia like his father, marrying Ada C.
            Smith and passing away on May 30, 1900.
            </p>
            <p>
            In contrast, their only daughter, Julia Wharton Lewis Keightley (formally known
            as Julia Wharton Lewis Campbell and Julia Wharton Lewis Ver Planck), became an
            author like Juliet. Julia was the most well-documented of the four Campbell
            children. She was born in 1851 or 1854, and her break into the literary world
            occurred following the deaths of her husband and two children, all of whom she
            lost within two years.<sup id="fnref12"><a href="#fn12"

            Planck, on December 21, 1871, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, Philadelphia,
            Pennsylvania; he died at the age of 32 on December 15, 1876, in Colorado.<sup

            After the death of her husband, she moved back home and lived with her parents
            for a while to aid her recovery from the illnesses she developed after the
            trauma of losing her husband and sons. During this period, she wrote two
            successful plays and learned about the Aryan Theosophical Society. On May 27,
            1886, Julia officially joined the Aryan Theosophical Society, helping to write
            several magazines in <em>The Path</em> and writing a book called <em>Letters
            That Have Helped Me </em>during her time there.<sup id="fnref17"><a href="#fn17"
            rel="footnote">17</a></sup> Many of her works were written under the pseudonym
            Jasper Niemand. In 1891, Julia remarried Dr. Archibald Keightley and settled on
            a property in New York City. They eventually moved to England following the
            declining health of Keightly's mother (Document AV).<sup id="fnref18"><a

            After moving to Pottsville, Pennsylvania, he established a successful legal
            practice and married Juliet Lewis in 1843. Campbell's interest in politics
            emerged in 1844 when he attended the Whig National Convention in Baltimore,
            marking the beginning of his involvement in public service (Document AX). There,
            Campbell developed a close relationship with the influential Henry Clay whom he
            supported for presidency.

            <p>
            Campbell additionally served as the host of celebrations and parades due to his
            status as a prominent lawyer in the city. Such celebrations and parades included
            the celebration of the Good Intent Engine fire brigade and the victory of the
            Pottsville Cricket Club (Document E). Campbell’s role in hosting these
            celebrations indicate that Campbell was influential in the social scene and
            possibly owned a large property in the city.
            </p>
            <p>
            In Pottsville, Campbell also joined the Miner’s Lodge of the Independent Order
            of Odd Fellows, a fraternal organization dedicated to community service and
            treatment for the sick (Document E). There, Campbell was responsible for
            providing the charter to the organization on December 9, 1851. As a lawyer,
            Campbell also assisted the organization of various companies, including the
            Pottsville Mutual and Joint Stock Life Insurance Company, of which he was an
            incorporator.

            <p>
            While presumably running a law firm in Pottsville, Campbell also mentored a
            number of students in law, including prominent Pottsville lawyers George Little,
            Christopher Little, and William Lebbeus Whitney (Document AO; Document B). In
            1891, Christopher Little—the son of the aforementioned George Little—committed
            suicide at the American Hotel in Mauch Chunk, PA.

            James Hepburn Campbell debuted in national politics in 1855 after being elected
            to the 34th Congress as an opposition Whig, representing Pennsylvania's 11th
            Congressional District, which included Schuylkill and Northumberland counties.
            (Document G). After being elected to the 34th Congress Campbell likely did not
            own any personal property in Washington D.C.; while keeping ownership of his
            Pottsville home, Campbell stayed at the National Hotel in the Capital with his
            wife. Although the National Hotel has long since been destroyed, the hotel was
            located at the northeast corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 6th Street near the
            White House.<sup id="fnref20"><a href="#fn20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            Initially, Campbell did not initially accept any committee assignments in
            Congress in contempt of Pennsylvania rival and House Speaker Galusha Grow whom
            he believed was giving him “inferior assignments” (Document AX). However, whilst
            in the 34th Congress, Campbell threw in his full support toward electing
            Nathaniel P. Banks—an American Party congressman—as the new House Speaker to
            succeed Grow (Document AT). As a reward, Campbell was assigned to the Committee
            of Ways and Means where he leveraged his position to block any efforts to lower
            the 1846 Walker Tariff (Document AX). In 1856, Campbell made a speech on the
            House floor criticizing the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the affair between Kansas
            and Missouri that followed (Document H). In the speech, Campbell made his
            support of the Democratic Governor of Kansas Andrew H. Reeder known, claiming
            that an “invading force from the State of Missouri” had illegitimately placed
            John Wilkins Whitfield, a pro-South politician who contested Reeder, in power.
            Here, Campbell showed that he did not strictly separate himself from other
            politicians based on party lines; it was through this speech that Campbell would
            begin building a reputation for himself as a talented politician and anti-slave
            Republican.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1856, Campbell again ran for a seat in the House of Representatives but lost
            reelection to the Democrat William L. Dewart.<sup id="fnref21"><a href="#fn21"
            rel="footnote">21</a></sup> During the period of time between the 34th and 36th
            Congresses, it is plausible that Campbell returned to Pottsville as he still
            owned the property. In 1858, Campbell defeated the incumbent Dewart and was
            overwhelmingly reelected to the 36th Congress representing the same district as
            he did previously (Document J). There, Campbell was assigned to the Committee of
            Elections but did not contribute significantly to any larger purpose or event
            (Document F). During his time in the 36th Congress, Campbell resided in the
            Washington House—also known as the United States Hotel—near Pennsylvania Avenue
            between 3rd and 4 ½ street with his wife.<sup id="fnref22"><a href="#fn22"

            <p>
            On January 11, Campbell, alongside George W. Scranton of Pennsylvania, made a
            speech on the House floor regarding the quickly shifting political landscape in
            America (Document L). In it, Campbell expressed his belief in the Union as a
            whole and indicated that he did not support regional rivalries. More
            importantly, Campbell directly opposed the idea of Southern secession, but also
            condemned the raid at Harpers Ferry by John Brown that happened a few months
            prior. Campbell’s reasonable stance on Southern hostility suggests that Campbell
            was not a so-called Radical Republican. In the speech, Campbell also detailed
            his friendship with the late Henry Clay—whom he supported in the 1844 Whig
            National Convention—and offered to support Southerner John Gilmer of North
            Carolina as House Speaker due to his close ties with Clay; Campbell also
            reflected on his support for the 1850 Compromise in his speech.
            </p>
            <p>
            On April 24, 1860, Campbell made a speech on the House floor in support of
            Representative Justin S. Morrill’s protectionist tariff (Document M). In the
            speech, Campbell referenced many trade relationships with nations such as
            Britain to argue for the raising of tariffs that would allow American workers to
            be more economically independent and protected. Seeing as how Campbell
            conspicuously urged the house to “[protect] everything American, against
            everything foreign,” it could be said that Campbell was a financial
            conservative. In part due to Campbell’s efforts, the Morrill Tariff Act was
            passed in 1861, raising tariff rates and improving tariff systems.
            </p>
            <p>
            As tensions between the North and South worsened in December of 1860, Campbell
            was appointed as the representative of Pennsylvania in the Committee of
            Thirty-Three following Hon. Alexander Boteler’s resolution to mediate the
            “perilous condition of the country.”<sup id="fnref25"><a href="#fn25"
            rel="footnote">25</a></sup> It was in this committee that Campbell fought
            against any form of compromise on slavery between the North and South, including
            the Crittenden Compromise and Corwin Amendment (Document AX; Document P).
            </p>
            <p>
            Following the election of Lincoln, the threat of secession from the Southern
            states led to several compromises regarding slavery to be floated from both the
            North and South, such as the Crittenden Compromise. In response, Campbell made a
            speech on the House floor rebuking any idea of compromise to the Southern states
            on February 14, 1861 (Document P). In the speech, Campbell argues that the
            Southern states—of which six had already vowed to secede—have no right to
            contest the election of Lincoln, and that the people had a right to see their
            elected president be inaugurated “with all the usual forms and ceremonies,
            without terms, without negotiation, without compromise, and without apology.”
            Campbell proceeded to describe the Crittenden Compromise as “despotic,”
            insisting that the Southern states either fall in line or betray the Union.
            </p>
            <p>
            In part due to Campbell’s staunch opposition to compromise, the Civil War broke
            out following the commencement of hostilities at Fort Sumter on April 12 of the
            same year. Upon hearing of the news, Campbell immediately rushed to the capital
            from his Pottsville home and was on the last train that passed freely through
            Baltimore to Washington (Document AT). After arriving in the city, Campbell
            enlisted in Cassius M. Clay’s battalion of volunteers (Document Q). As the
            battalion was initially the only troops defending Washington from Southern
            rebels, Clay’s battalion became known as the “Washington Guards”<sup
            id="fnref26"><a href="#fn26" rel="footnote">26</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup
            id="fnref27"><a href="#fn27" rel="footnote">27</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup
            id="fnref28"><a href="#fn28" rel="footnote">28</a></sup> The battalion was
            disbanded within a few days after being relieved by professional infantry
            hailing from other Northern states; only a few days after the battalion was
            relieved, the 6th Massachusetts who was stationed in the city came under attack
            from a rebel mob.
            </p>
            <p>
            Following the relieving of Clay’s battalion, on April 18 of the same year,
            Campbell formally enlisted in the 25th Regiment of Pennslyvania Volunteers where
            he was elected as a Major in the F&S companies (Document R).<sup id="fnref29"><a
            href="#fn29" rel="footnote">29</a></sup> Campbell saw little action in the 25th
            as the regiment was not active in direct combat against Confederate troops; the
            regiment existed only three months before it was mustered out of service.<sup
            id="fnref30"><a href="#fn30" rel="footnote">30</a></sup> This regiment, in a
            very similar fashion to the Washington Guards, was dubbed the ‘First Defenders’
            due to its immediate response to Lincoln’s call for troops.<sup id="fnref31"><a
            href="#fn31" rel="footnote">31</a></sup> As the regiment had only been formed on
            a three-month term, Campbell was honorably discharged from the regiment in July.
            </p>
            <p>
            After returning from his military service, Campbell again returned to Congress
            as he was elected in October of 1860 to the 37th Congress representing his usual
            district (Document N). In the 37th Congress, Campbell was initially appointed to
            the Committee of Elections, the Committee on Expenditures in the Treasury
            Department, and the Committee of Public Expenditures (Document F). During the
            37th Congress, Campbell again resided in the Washington House hotel with his
            wife (Document O).
            </p>
            <p>
            In March of 1862, the stalemate on the Eastern front of the Civil War near the
            Potomac drove many Republicans to pressure the White House for immediate and
            decisive action. Among them was Campbell, who, alongside William M. Davis of
            Pennsylvania and John Hutchins of Ohio, visited and interviewed Lincoln
            (Document S). In his recollection, Campbell explained how Congressmen should
            consult with the president instead of attacking him; Campbell also urged the
            President to break the Confederate presence near the Potomac and Capitol. To
            this, Lincoln hinted towards a possible offensive by General George McLellan.
            </p>
            <p>
            Although Campbell did not do anything of significance in his other committees,
            he was later appointed as the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Pacific
            Railroad in 1862 (Document T). On the Committee, Campbell oversaw the
            organization of the first transcontinental railroad from Missouri to California
            and advocated for the adoption of the central route following Southern secession
            (Document AQ). On April 8, 1862, Campbell made a speech on the House floor
            emphasizing the importance of a transcontinental railroad, arguing that the
            construction of a Pacific Railroad would better unify the country (Document U).
            Campbell argued that both communication and transportation would be
            revolutionized with its construction; his familiarity with the intricate details
            of the railroad’s plans indicated that Campbell was closely involved with the
            railroad itself.
            </p>
            <p>
            On June 24 of the same year, Congress, with Campbell as the sponsor of the bill,
            passed the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 with the Senate’s amendments (Document
            V); the bill was signed into law by Abraham Lincoln on July 1st of the same
            year. This bill, alongside Campbell’s related speech, can be reasonably viewed
            as the pinnacle of Campbell’s career—as the Pacific Railway Acts were among the
            most influential pieces of legislation regarding economics and trade in the
            U.S., Campbell’s efforts, although unrecognized, have had a permanent effect on
            the growth of America as a nation and economic powerhouse.
            </p>
            <p>
            Only a week before he would pass the first Pacific Railway Act through Congress,
            Campbell voted in favor of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts—a bill that created
            land-grant colleges like Penn State and MIT from the proceeds of land sales
            (Document V). However, as these land sales were infamous for having been sourced
            from the exploitation of Native lands, it could be argued that Campbell was not
            particularly sensitive to the plight of the Native Americans at the time. It
            does show, however, that Campbell was a supporter of the expansion of higher
            education.
            </p>
            <p>
            After Campbell’s defeat in the 1862 Congressional elections, Campbell recounted
            in his letters to his wife how Secretary of the Senate John W. Forney notified
            him of Lincoln’s particular regret in Campbell’s political defeat; it can be
            seen here that Campbell may have held a relatively close relationship with the
            President (Document S). In January of 1863, Campbell was received by Mrs.
            Abraham Lincoln at the White House, where he, alongside General Simon Cameron,
            “gossiped” with the First Lady about her Southern heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
            On February 25th of the same year, Campbell voted in favor of the monumental
            Enrollment Act; the Enrollment Act, also the Civil War Military Draft Act, was
            essentially the first conscription legislation passed in the U.S. Campbell’s
            support of this act possibly derives from his “vigorous military methods” and
            intolerance for secession.<sup id="fnref32"><a href="#fn32"
            rel="footnote">32</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            In June of 1863, Campbell again registered for the military draft following
            Governor Andrew Curtin’s call for volunteers (Document Y). He did not serve as
            an infantryman, however; Campbell alongside General James Nagle privately raised
            the 39th Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteer Militia following General Robert E.
            Lee’s advance into southern Pennsylvania (Document A; Document AQ). The unit,
            composed mostly of men from Schuylkill County, did not actively contribute to
            combat as Lee’s troops had already begun a southern retreat following the
            decisive Northern victory at Gettysburg (Document B). The regiment merely
            followed the footprints of Lee’s army in the campaign to pursue and destroy Lee.
            Campbell was left in charge of the regiment as a lieutenant colonel after James
            Nagle was promoted to Brigadier General. The regiment was mustered out of
            service nearly a month after its formation (Document Z).
            </p>
            <p>
            In the 1862 Congressional elections, the unpopularity of the Civil
            War—particularly in the Schuylkill and Northumberland counties he
            represented—led to Campbell’s failed election to the 38th Congress (Document S).
            Following the end of his term in the 37th Congress and service in the military,
            Campbell was personally recommended via letter by many highly influential
            figures and politicians to serve as a diplomatic mission on behalf of the U.S.
            (Document W; Document X). Based on the contents of such letters, Campbell had
            many connections to prominent politicians including former Pennsylvania
            Governors James Pollock and Andrew Curtin as well as former Vice President
            Hannibal Hamlin. As such, in 1864, Campbell was appointed by then-President
            Abraham Lincoln to serve as the Minister Resident to Sweden and Norway; Campbell
            served this station from the years 1864-1867 (Document AC; Document AJ).
            Campbell notably declined the offer of the Lincoln administration to be assigned
            as a judge on the Court for the Suppression of the Slave Trade in Cape Town,
            South Africa before accepting this position (Document AX).
            </p>
            <p>
            On July 22, 1864, Secretary of State William H. Seward wrote a request to the
            relevant European nations to provide free travel for Campbell in preparation for
            his arrival in Stockholm (Document AD). As such, on September 17, 1864, Campbell
            arrived unmolested in Stockholm with his family through the German cities of
            Cologne and Lubeck (Document AE). There, he secured an apartment for his stay
            and began preparations for the assumption of duty from his predecessor Jacob S.
            Haldeman. Shortly after his arrival, Campbell met for an interview with the
            Swedish Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Ludvig Manderstrom where he made
            a fantastic first impression while discussing the Civil War. On the 24th and
            25th, Campbell met with King Charles XV and Queen Lovisa of Sweden separately in
            Ulriksdale Palace, remarking that he “could not have been received more kindly
            by any gentleman in Europe.”
            </p>
            <p>
             While only a portion of his activities are readily documented, it is known that
            Campbell worked to construct greater relations between the Swedish and American
            states by acquiring the language and culture while touring the country as the
            Minister Resident (Document AE; Document AQ). To this effect, Campbell
            participated in various cultural and social celebrations such as the fiftieth
            anniversary of the union between Sweden and Norway (Document AE).
            </p>
            <p>
            In December, Campbell handled his first, albeit small, diplomatic conflict where
            he made it known to Count Manderstrom the American government’s displeasure that
            Sweden had dispatched Baron Nils de Wetterstedt as an envoy to the Mexican
            Empire (not to be confused with the Republic of Mexico). Prior to his arrival as
            a Minister to the U.S., Wetterstedt had been sent on diplomatic business to the
            French-backed Mexican Empire that the U.S. deemed illegitimate. Nevertheless,
            Campbell and Manderstrom maintained a light mood throughout their meeting, with
            the two joking that Russia, who also dispatched an envoy to the Mexican Empire,
            was no better a friend to America than Sweden. This interaction likely indicates
            that Campbell generally handled diplomatic affairs in Sweden cordially and
            professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
            In early 1865, it is likely that Campbell traveled across Europe, specifically
            France and Paris. On May 23, 1865, the Swedish Prime Minister’s Office for
            External Affairs requested that the nations of Prussia, Austria, Switzerland,
            Italy, and France grant Campbell free travel after Campbell had “communicated
            his desire to travel” to these countries (Document AI). Based on this desire, as
            well as the Office’s request, it is likely that Campbell traveled across Europe
            in 1865; this could possibly be related to the recent shift in the European
            political realm following the Second Schleswig War and its influence on
            Scandinavia (Document AE).
            </p>
            <p>
            Before the Foreign Office issued the laissez-passer request for Campbell, it is
            likely he had already traveled to Paris for a short period of time (Document
            AI). Campbell’s presence in Paris at this time can be verified by his induction
            as one of the Presidents d’Honneur of the Institut d’Afrique in Paris in
            February of 1865 (Document AH). The Institut d’Afrique was a French organization
            formed in 1838 to push for the abolition of the slave trade but also advocated
            the colonization of Africa.<sup id="fnref33"><a href="#fn33"
            rel="footnote">33</a></sup> Seeing as how the Institut d’Afrique supported
            colonization, Campbell himself may have also supported colonization whilst
            opposing slavery. In the letter of his induction, the General Secretary of the
            Institute wrote how the organization would be “flattered” to have him as a
            President d’Honneur; this likely indicated that Campbell’s efforts to abolish
            the slave trade were recognized internationally. Based on how the Institut
            d’Afrique’s members were almost exclusively composed of members in Paris, and
            how the title of President d’Honneur had a membership fee of at least 20 francs,
            it can be inferred that Campbell may have stayed in Paris for a period of time
            in 1865.

            <p>
            A glimpse into Campbell’s ability was shown shortly before the end of the Civil
            War in March-April of 1865 when he potentially foiled a Confederate plot to
            procure a Swedish vessel for the purpose of piracy (Document AG). In the letters
            between Minister Resident to Denmark Bradford Wood and Campbell, it was said
            that Confederate agents had been “prowling” Copenhagen in search of a merchant
            vessel to purchase and arm. As a precaution, Campbell placed the U.S. consuls at
            Swedish and Norwegian ports on high alert against potential Confederate activity
            and offered to notify the Swedish authorities on the matter. Though it was only
            days later that the Confederacy would surrender and end the Civil War, this
            could be seen as one of the more noteworthy affairs in Campbell’s service as
            Resident Minister as it displayed his competence and decisiveness in a time of
            stress.
            </p>
            <p>
            Campbell also served as the channel through which diplomatic correspondences
            between the two countries—such as the condolences of the Swedish king following
            President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination—were conveyed (Document AF). Following
            the assassination plot on President Lincoln and Secretary of State William H.
            Seward, Campbell wrote a letter to Seward where he reported the reaction of the
            Swedish people to the assassination and wished Seward a hasty recovery. Notably,
            Campbell revealed his reverence for Lincoln and wrote how Lincoln, whom he “knew
            and loved as a personal friend,” dedicated his life to the Union and preserved
            American liberty. The death of Lincoln likely deeply affected Campbell as he had
            interacted with the late President on more than one occasion, particularly when
            meeting with him in early 1862 (Document S).
            </p>
            <p>
            On November 15, 1866, it was decided by the Johnson administration that John
            McGinnis was to replace Campbell as Minister Resident and that Campbell was to
            be appointed as Minister Resident to Colombia in Bogota (Document AJ). However,
            these decisions were yet to be passed through the Senate, and McGinnis’
            appointment would ultimately be rebuffed by a Senate vote. As such, Campbell did
            not meet McGinnis in Paris to organize the transfer of power to his successor.
            </p>
            <p>
            On March 29, Campbell presented a recall and exchanged thanks with King Charles
            in the Royal Palace where he was afforded a ceremonious farewell by the Royal
            family.<sup id="fnref34"><a href="#fn34" rel="footnote">34</a></sup> After his
            term as Minister Resident to Sweden-Norway ended, the newly-inaugurated
            President Andrew Johnson offered Campbell the aforementioned second diplomatic
            post as the Minister Resident to Colombia in Bogota; however, Campbell rejected
            this position in protest of the Johnson administration which was sympathetic to
            the South (Document AJ; Document AQ).<sup id="fnref35"><a href="#fn35"
            rel="footnote">35</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            Before his return to America on June 14, 1867, Campbell was elected as a
            Companion of the First Class of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the
            United States (MOLLUS) (Document AK). MOLLUS, whilst sounding like a military
            award, was actually one of the first military fraternal organizations; MOLLUS
            was formed following the assassination of Lincoln as an organization of officers
            that fought in the Civil War. First Class Companions of the Order such as
            Campbell were composed of only veteran commissioned officers of the U.S. Army
            who fought in the Civil War. Notable members of MOLLUS included Ulysses S.
            Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, William McKinley, and George Custer.
            </p>
            <p>
            In August of 1867, Campbell officially moved back to the States and took
            residence in Philadelphia to resume the practice of law (Document S; Document
            AQ). It is probable that around this time Campbell purchased a property at 2039
            Delaney Place in Philadelphia to reside with his wife and daughter, Julia Ver
            Planck (Document AM).<sup id="fnref36"><a href="#fn36"
            rel="footnote">36</a></sup> Julia initially moved away from Campbell to live
            with her husband, but moved back following the death of her husband and
            sons.<sup id="fnref37"><a href="#fn37" rel="footnote">37</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite a shortage of city records during the period, it is known that by 1876
            Campbell was working at a law firm at 130 S 6th Street—the street also known as
            “Lawyer’s Row”—with other prominent lawyers (Document AL). While he was working
            at this firm, Campbell worked on numerous prominent cases such as the 1883
            Packer Estate case, which was elevated to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
            (Document AN). In the case, Campbell represented the estate of Barnabas Hammett;
            The Supreme Court ruled that guardians, after initiating a legal case for a
            minor, no longer have authority after the minor becomes an adult.
            </p>
            <p>
            Campbell’s life slowed down following his departure from politics, and Campbell
            bought a separate estate for his family in Wayne, PA. The estate, known as
            “Aeola,” was located at 705 Church Rd in Wayne (Document AU). In a photograph
            taken in 1898, three years after his death, the estate appeared very large and
            well-kept, with a path going around the house and deliberate maintenance of
            plants and decorations. In Allan Peskin’s “Two White House Visits,” the estate
            is described as a “farm,” which is corroborated by the large plot of land the
            house occupies on satellite imagery (Document S).
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on Campbell’s absence in Gopsill’s 1887 Philadelphia city directory,
            Campbell retired from his practice of law at 130 S 6th Street and dedicated the
            rest of his years to agriculture at his Aeola estate (Document AT).<sup
            id="fnref38"><a href="#fn38" rel="footnote">38</a></sup> In June of 1893,
            Campbell celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his marriage to his wife Juliet
            at the estate (Document AP). Campbell, who was the only surviving son of Francis
            C. Campbell by 1893, invited old friends from across the country to attend the
            lavish celebration.
            </p>
            <p>
                On April 12, 1895, James Hepburn Campbell passed away due to heart failure at
            the age of 75 at his Aeola estate (Document AS). His daughter, Julia Wharton
            Lewis Keightley, planned to spend the summer with her parents after arriving in
            Philadelphia from London, but was instead met with the news of her father’s
            passing (Document AT). His funeral was held at St. Mary’s Church in Wayne on
            April 17 at 10:45 A.M.<sup id="fnref39"><a href="#fn39"
            rel="footnote">39</a></sup> Campbell was interned the same day at the Woodlands
            Cemetery where the rest of his family was also buried.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            After his death, James Hepburn Campbell left behind a remarkable legacy of
            public service, resilience, and honor to the abolition of slavery and the Union.
            From his admission to the Bar in 1841 to his appointment as Minister Resident to
            Sweden-Norway, Campbell fought for justice, order, and to build harmonious
            relations both in and outside the U.S. On countless occasions Campbell's ability
            as an orator and politician was put on full display; his legacy was immortalized
            in his sponsoring of the famous Pacific Railway Act of 1862. Despite setbacks
            such as the loss of his sons and defeat in the 1862 elections, Campbell remained
            dedicated to fulfilling his duty as a patriotic American. Campbell's life,
            marked by both private and professional achievements, stands out in history as
            an example of steadfast dedication and selfless service to one's nation and
            community.
