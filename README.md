          The Woodlands Cemetery Project is a rigorous research project conducted alongside the A.P. United States
          History course taught at Julia R. Masterman High School. Students research and unearth the lives of deceased
          individuals who lived primarily during the nineteenth century. All individuals researched are buried in the
          Woodlands Cemetery, a historic and scenic burial ground in West Philadelphia that served as the final resting
          place for many famous figures in American history, including Philadelphia elites, generals, inventors, and
          artists. In early fall, students traveled to the Woodlands Cemetery to search for potential candidates to
          research for the project. While over 30,000 are buried in the Woodlands Cemetery, only a small fraction of
          them have had their stories uncovered, leaving countless lives and legacies obscured by time.
          To piece together the history of their subject, students must extensively analyze a wide range of primary and
          secondary sources, strengthening students’ research proficiency, investigation, and analytical interpretation
          skills. Students are split into small groups of five to six members and conduct research for approximately
          five months, culminating in a biography paper and a website. The biographies are the culmination of multiple
          months of students’ meticulous research, and sources range from physical archival documents, government
          records, and newspaper articles, to obituaries.
          Out of a plethora of candidates to research, this group selected James Hepburn Campbell, a former Congressman
          representing Schuylkill and Northumberland counties in Pennsylvania. Campbell was born to Francis C. Campbell
          and Jane H. Campbell and lived most of his life as a lawyer but more importantly served in the Congress and
          the Army. A man of fiery patriotism, he enlisted in the ranks during the Civil War despite being an active
          member of Congress to defend the capital and stop General Lee’s march north into Pennsylvania. While serving
          in Congress, Campbell was appointed to multiple government committees and was later appointed Resident
          Minister to Sweden; Campbell was influential to the passage of the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 and dedicated
          much of his political career to the abolition of slavery. He dedicated the last years of his life to his law
          practice and family including his wife, and prominent writer, Juliet Campbell.
